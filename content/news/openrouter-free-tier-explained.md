OpenRouter is the backbone of VibeClaw's free tier. But "free" always has fine print. Let's break it down.

## What's Actually Free

OpenRouter offers models tagged `:free` that cost nothing per token. As of February 2026, the usable ones include:

- **Solar Pro 3** (Upstage) — fast, reliable, great for general chat
- **Llama 3.1 8B** (Meta) — solid all-rounder
- **Gemma 3 4B** (Google) — surprisingly good for its size
- **Qwen3 8B** (Alibaba) — strong multilingual support
- **DeepSeek R1** — reasoning beast, free distilled version
- **Phi-4 Reasoning** (Microsoft) — MIT licensed, great for code
- **Mistral Small 3.1** (Mistral) — Apache 2.0, fast

## The Limits

Free models have rate limits, but they're generous for individual use:

- **~20 requests/minute** for most models
- **~200 requests/day** soft cap (varies by model)
- **Queue priority** — paid users get faster responses during peak times
- **No SLA** — if a free model goes down, there's no guarantee on uptime

For building and testing agents? Totally fine. For production with paying customers? You'll want to upgrade.

## The Quality Reality

Free models in 2026 are better than GPT-4 was in 2023. That's not hype — it's benchmark fact. Solar Pro 3 handles most coding, writing, and reasoning tasks with zero issues.

Where free models still struggle:
- **Very long context** — most cap at 8-32K tokens
- **Complex multi-step reasoning** — R1 handles this but is slower
- **Image understanding** — limited options in the free tier
- **Guaranteed consistency** — paid models are more predictable

## VibeClaw + OpenRouter

VibeClaw defaults to Solar Pro 3 specifically because it's the best balance of speed, quality, and reliability in the free tier. You don't need an API key — we handle the routing.

When you're ready for Claude Opus or GPT-5, that's where VibeClaw Pro comes in. But honestly? Start free. You might not need to upgrade.
