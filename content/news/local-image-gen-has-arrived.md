summary: FLUX.1, Qwen Image Edit, SDXL running on your own hardware — no API key, no rate limits, no content policy. The local image generation stack is now good enough to replace cloud services for most use cases.

Something has quietly shifted in local AI image generation. It's no longer a hobbyist experiment that produces mediocre outputs. The 2025-2026 generation of open models — FLUX.1-schnell, Qwen Image Edit 2511, SDXL with its enormous LoRA ecosystem — are genuinely competitive with the commercial APIs, and running them locally is now practical for anyone with a modern GPU.

**FLUX.1-schnell** in fp8 quantisation generates sharp 1024×1024 images in under 10 seconds on mid-range hardware, and under 4 on high-end. That's within the same ballpark as Midjourney API latency, with zero rate limits, zero per-image cost, and zero content moderation constraints.

**Qwen Image Edit 2511** is the more interesting story. The model — released by Alibaba's Qwen team — takes a source image and a natural language instruction ("make the background a rainy street at night," "remove the person on the left") and executes the edit with a level of coherence that would have required Photoshop expertise six months ago. Running via ComfyUI with the QwenEditUtils custom nodes, the whole pipeline is self-contained.

The orchestration layer that makes this practical is ComfyUI. It's not pretty, but it's the most powerful local AI workflow system available: models compose together like Lego, custom nodes extend any capability gap, and the HTTP API makes it trivial to wire into your own applications.

What this means practically:

- **No API bills** accumulating in the background as you iterate
- **No content policies** triggering on legitimate creative work  
- **Full output ownership** — nothing is uploaded, logged, or used for training
- **Composable pipelines** — chain image gen into larger agentic workflows

The tooling to orchestrate this through agents like OpenClaw is already mature. A local image generation server wrapping ComfyUI can expose an OpenAI-compatible `/v1/images/generations` endpoint — drop-in replacement for the cloud APIs in any agent workflow.

The remaining friction is hardware cost. A system capable of running FLUX.1 comfortably (24GB+ VRAM) still runs several thousand dollars. Nvidia's DGX Spark brings 128GB of unified memory into a compact form factor, which changes the equation for serious users.

But even mid-range consumer cards (RTX 4070, 16GB) handle FLUX.1-schnell well. And the models are only getting more efficient as quantisation techniques mature — the gap between "the biggest thing you can run locally" and "the best thing in the cloud" is shrinking every quarter.

The practical conclusion: if you're still paying per-image to a commercial API for most use cases, it's worth spending a weekend setting up local generation. The infrastructure is there. The models are there. The savings compound quickly.
