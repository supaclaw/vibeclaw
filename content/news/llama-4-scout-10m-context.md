Meta just released **Llama 4 Scout**, and it's a big deal for open-source AI.

## The Numbers

- **109B parameters** with 16 mixture-of-experts (MoE) — only 17B active at any time
- **10 million token context window** — that's roughly 30 full novels
- **MoE architecture** means lower compute per token than a dense 109B model
- **Natively multimodal** — handles text and images
- Licensed under the **Llama 4 Community License** (commercial use allowed)

## Why It Matters

The 10M context window is the headline, but the real story is efficiency. By using mixture-of-experts, Meta gets strong performance while only activating 17B parameters per token — far less compute than a dense 109B model would require.

There's also Llama 4 Maverick (17B x 128 experts, 400B total) with a 1M context window for even more capable workloads.
