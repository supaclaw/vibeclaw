You don't need to be a developer to build an AI agent. Here's how to create a useful DevOps monitoring agent in under 3 minutes using VibeClaw's Forge.

## What We're Building

An agent that:
- Monitors server health via SSH
- Checks log files for errors
- Sends alerts when something breaks
- Runs on a schedule

## Step 1: Open Forge (30 seconds)

Go to [vibeclaw.dev/forge](https://vibeclaw.dev/forge) and start with the **DevOps** template. This pre-fills sensible defaults:

- Model: Solar Pro 3 (free, fast, reliable)
- System prompt: DevOps-focused instructions
- Tools: filesystem, shell execution

## Step 2: Customize the System Prompt (60 seconds)

Replace the default system prompt with something specific:

```
You are a DevOps monitoring agent. Every time you run:
1. Check server uptime and load average
2. Scan /var/log/syslog for ERROR or CRITICAL entries from the last hour
3. Check disk usage — alert if any partition is over 85%
4. Check if nginx/apache is responding on port 80
5. Report findings concisely. Only alert me if something needs attention.
```

## Step 3: Add MCP Servers (60 seconds)

In the Tools step, add:
- **Filesystem server** — so the agent can read log files
- **Shell server** — so it can run commands like `df -h` and `curl localhost`

VibeClaw's Forge has these as one-click additions.

## Step 4: Save & Export (30 seconds)

Hit Save to add it to your library. Then export as a `.vibeclaw.json` file. This config can be loaded into any OpenClaw instance.

## Running It

Import the config into your OpenClaw server:

```bash
openclaw config import devops-agent.vibeclaw.json
```

Set up a cron schedule to run it every 15 minutes, and you've got a free AI-powered monitoring system.

## Why This Works

The magic isn't in the model — it's in the **system prompt + tools** combination. A well-instructed Solar Pro 3 with shell access can do 80% of what expensive monitoring tools do. For free.
