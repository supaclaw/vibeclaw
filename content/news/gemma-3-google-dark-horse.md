Google doesn't get enough credit for Gemma. While Meta and Alibaba dominate the open-source AI headlines, **Gemma 3** has been quietly winning on the metrics that matter for real-world use.

## The Lineup

| Variant | Parameters | VRAM | Speed | License |
|---------|-----------|------|-------|---------|
| Gemma 3 4B | 4B | 3GB | Very fast | Google |
| Gemma 3 12B | 12B | 8GB | Fast | Google |
| Gemma 3 27B | 27B | 16GB | Moderate | Google |

The 4B model runs on basically anything — phones, Raspberry Pis, old laptops. The 27B model fits on a single consumer GPU.

## Why Gemma Wins on Efficiency

Google's distillation process is genuinely best-in-class. Gemma 3 4B outperforms models 2-3x its size on practical tasks:

- **Instruction following**: Better than Llama 3.1 8B at following complex multi-step instructions
- **Code generation**: Competitive with Phi-4 at nearly 1/3 the parameters
- **Multilingual**: Strong across European and Asian languages
- **Structured output**: Excellent at generating valid JSON and XML

## The "Google License" Question

Gemma isn't Apache 2.0 or MIT. It uses Google's own license, which is permissive but includes:

- Acceptable use restrictions (no weapons, surveillance, etc.)
- A 30-day cure period for violations
- Google's standard IP indemnification

For most developers and businesses, this is fine. But if you need maximum legal simplicity, Phi-4 (MIT) or Mistral Small (Apache 2.0) might be safer bets.

## The Secret Weapon: Multimodal

Gemma 3's vision variants can process images alongside text. At 4B parameters, that's remarkable. You can build a visual assistant that runs on a phone.

## Try It

Gemma 3 4B is free on OpenRouter and available in [VibeClaw](https://vibeclaw.dev). It's our recommended model for low-latency applications where speed matters more than maximum capability.
