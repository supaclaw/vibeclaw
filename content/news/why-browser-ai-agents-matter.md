Everyone's building AI agents that run on servers. We think the interesting stuff happens when they run **in your browser**.

## The Server Problem

Running an AI agent today means:

1. Rent a VPS ($5-50/month)
2. Install Node.js
3. Configure API keys
4. Set up a database
5. Deal with SSL certificates
6. Monitor uptime
7. Pay for it all, every month

That's a lot of steps before you can even say "hello" to your agent.

## The Browser Solution

What if you just... opened a tab?

VibeClaw runs a complete OpenClaw instance in your browser. The runtime, the virtual filesystem, the agent loop — all of it executes in a web worker. Your API calls go directly from your browser to the model provider. Nothing touches our servers.

This means:

- **Zero setup** — open the page, click boot, start chatting
- **Zero cost to us** — we don't proxy your API calls, so we don't pay for your usage
- **Zero trust required** — your keys never leave your browser
- **Instant experimentation** — try 10 different agent configs in 10 minutes

## What You Lose

Let's be honest about the tradeoffs:

- **No 24/7 operation** — close the tab, agent stops
- **No persistent memory** — (yet — we're working on it)
- **No incoming messages** — can't receive WhatsApp/Telegram while the browser is closed
- **Performance ceiling** — a browser sandbox isn't as fast as a dedicated server

For always-on agents, you still want a server. But for building, testing, experimenting, and learning? The browser wins.

## The Hybrid Future

The interesting play is using VibeClaw to **build** your agent config, test it in the browser sandbox, then **export** it to a real OpenClaw server. Best of both worlds: friction-free experimentation, production-grade deployment.

That's what we're building toward.
